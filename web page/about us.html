        <p><i>-/The history of Toyota started in 1933 with the company being a division of Toyoda Automatic Loom,
              Works devoted to the production of cars under the direction of the founder's son, Kiichiro Toyoda.
              [1] Kiichiro Toyoda had traveled to Europe and the United States in 1929 to investigate automobile
              production and had begun researching gasoline-powered engines in 1930. Toyoda Automatic Loom Works
              was encouraged to develop automobile production by the Japanese government, which needed domestic 
              vehicle production, due to the war with China.[2] Kiichiro Toyoda seized this opportunity to establish
              the Automotive Production Division on September 1, 1933, and began preparing to build prototype vehicles.
              In 1934, the division produced its first Type A Engine, which was used in the first Model A1 passenger 
              car in May 1935 and the G1 truck in August 1935. Production of the Model AA passenger car started in 1936.
              Early vehicles bear a striking resemblance to the Dodge Power Wagon and 1930's Chevrolet, with some parts
              actually interchanging with their American originals./-</i></p>
